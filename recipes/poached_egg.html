        <p>Home-cooked. Cheap. Easy. Quick.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) water</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt or vinegar (optional, helps the egg white hold)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>microwave-safe mug or bowl</li>
                <li>slotted spoon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 1/2 cup of water, or enough amount to fully submerge an egg, into a microwave-safe mug or bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir the water briefly in order to help spread out heat and prevent hot spots.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg gently into the mug/bowl of water. Make sure they are intact to ensure we're doing poached egg not egg drop soup recipe.</li>
                <li>Microwave on MEDIUM power (about 600-700 watts). Start with 45-60 seconds. Carefully stir around egg midway.</li>
                <li>Check doness. The egg white should be set, and the yolk should be soft. If it needs more time, microwave in 10-second bursts.</li>
                <li>Remove carefully with a slotted spoon. Let it drain for a few seconds, then serve.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pierce the yolk if microwaving an egg whole - but for poaching, it's submerged in water so it's safer.</li>
                <li>Microwave ovens vary. Yours might need more or less time so test.</li>
                <li>If your microwave doesn't let you set power, reduce cooking time instead.</li>
            </ul>
